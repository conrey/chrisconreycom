<h1>Who is Chris Conrey?</h1>
<p>
Chris' background in technology and development, combined with his focus on relationship building and network curation, makes him an expert at translating business needs into technical execution. 	A natural at skillfully launching Vuurr and its clients into impressive business deals, he’s not just the sales guy; Chris is the rhino glue between Vuurr’s successful connections and its behind-the-scenes engineering finesse. With proven results and past experience to support his credibility, Chris holds the reigns on postmodern marketing needs and the essential partnership skills to develop a fan base bigger than your company’s softball league. </p>

<p>
	When he’s not cranking away at Vuurr, he’s cheering on his Red Sox, reading, writing and, in general, just being a giant nerd. Sometimes, he lets his three daughters try their hands in the lego box and make a Star Wars mess out of the living room. Chris received his BA in Organizational Communication from the University of Colorado. His real education began shortly thereafter and hasn't stopped yet.
